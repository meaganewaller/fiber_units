# Typed measurements and counts for fiber arts calculations.
#
# The library provides dimension-specific value objects for common craft
# measurements such as length, weight, stitch counts, and row counts.
# It also extends `Numeric` with constructors like `4.inches` and
# `20.stitches` for readable pattern math.
